 * distribution stays free of Pi Node dependencies.
 *
 * Wire it up on the server: `const client = createPiNodeClient({ workspacePath })`,
 * then expose `client` over your transport (e.g. HTTP/SSE routes paired with
 * `createPiHttpClient`) or hand it straight to `usePiRuntime` in a
 * colocated/Electron setup.
